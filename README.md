## Harry Potter Queries
### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/1o4qRGxYVR8
### Description: Make different queries to learn about wizards, spells or potions in the world of the "boy who lived"

I wanted to showcase some of what I learned through CS50P, and I thought of no better way of doing it than following on the steps of what proffesor Malan did, based the work on the world of Harry Potter.

I searched for a Harry Potter database thaw would have an API, so I could make queries about the information I wanted to find instead of googling it and browse through the results.

Apart from spells, which I presume would be one of the first things people would be interested about, I wanted to know some obscure details about the characters, so I wrote the program to search for the patronus and boggart of the wizard of your choice. That's how I found out Voldemort was Cedric's worst nightmare.

For completion's sake, I added some alchemy to the mix. If you want to know the effects some potions might have on a fellow citizen, you can do that too.

I've decided to use a library called "rich", so as to recieve output from the console in a more legible way. Then, I divided every query into a different function, "Wizards", "Spells", "Potions", "Patronus" and "Boggart".

Building this project helped me solidified concepts like loops, input validation and functions. After completing it I feel I want to push the boundaries of what I know, encouraged to learn more about Python and to explore other languages.
